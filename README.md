# moodle-report_completionoverview
The course completion overview report is a simple reporting tool based on the existing course completion report. This plugin allows the Moodle Admin and system level Managers to view course completion tracking information from a centralised location rather than having to access each course individually.
This plugin is for Moodle 3.3 and 3.4
